This AVsitter release adds a new option to the ONSIT RLV command, to respect automatic sitter asignment. It allows also to create empty BUTTONs, specify position and rotation in one go in AVpos-shifter, and use the same LockGuard setting for all poses. Apart from that, a bit more memory should be available, and several bugs have been fixed.

As for the OpenSim version, most plugins and utilities are now added. Sorry, no AVcontrol yet.

Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/AVsitter/AVsitter/releases/tag/2.2-03) for details.
