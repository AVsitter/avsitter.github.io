[Version 2.2-01](https://github.com/AVsitter/AVsitter/releases/tag/2.2-01) has been released. The purpose of this version is to bring the Marketplace/updater package in sync with GitHub.

The use of a new version of the optimizer has allowed a little memory saving of about 500 extra bytes, too, so there's actually a small advantage in using this version.

It's also the first GitHub release made by Sei, so please excuse the pilot error that led to needing a repackaging! If you downloaded `AVsitter2.2-01.zip` from GitHub, please go to the [release](https://github.com/AVsitter/AVsitter/releases/tag/2.2-01) page and grab `AVsitter2.2-01-b.zip`
