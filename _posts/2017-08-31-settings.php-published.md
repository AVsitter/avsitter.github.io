Given the interest that some people have shown in the `settings.php` script (the one that shows the dumps in the web), this script has been made publicly available in GitHub. We do not provide support for this script, so it's up to the user to correctly install and use it in their web servers.

This doesn't mean that the service we provide will be interrupted: service for the web-based dumps in our server will continue indefinitely.
